    "<font size=\"6\"><b>1. Data Modelling</b></font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=\"4\">Congratulations! You’ve been hired as part of the new Data Engineering and Management team in the AirBNB Business Intelligence department. The company is restructuring due to unsatisfactory performance from the previous teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before leaving, the head of the Data Modelling department highlighted several issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Storage**: A lot of data about AirBNB listings is stored in a single document. While this approach has some advantages, it has also caused performance issues. Queries are slow, and the team didn’t apply patterns, which could improve performance by optimizing the data model. Indexes were also not used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reviews Growth**: The number of reviews for AirBNB is growing rapidly. Currently, we overwrite reviews regularly, but the Business Intelligence department will benefit from storing all reviews and analyzing them over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Errors**: There are errors in the data collection, such as duplicate data entries and incorrect timestamps for transactions. The new team will need to decide how to fix these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Role**: In your new role, you’ll need to consider how each database query is used, how often it is needed, and its impact on reads and writes. You should update the database schema to optimize for business use cases. Use tools like embedding, linking, indexes, and patterns to improve the data model. You may need to create new fields, documents, or collections. Be sure to document the pattern you’re applying and the reasons behind your decisions, especially when dealing with duplication and risks of outdated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key tasks include**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Streamlining the data collection process.\n",
    "2. Cleaning up the data and optimizing what will be returned for each use case.\n",
    "3. Applying the correct patterns to speed up common queries.\n",
    "4. Ensuring departments get accurate and relevant information from the database.\n",
    "5. Sharing the updated data model schema with other departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good Practices**: [Check Chapter 6, Mastering MongoDB]\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All newly created fields should have capitalized names.\n",
    "2. New queries should work with the most up-to-date database version. If you make multiple changes, all queries should still work after the final updates.\n",
    "3. For some queries, you may need to change the database schema.\n",
    "4. When you are applying specific patterns, like polymorphic, subset, or bucket, name them accordingly. \n",
    "5. Document each major transformation using this format:\n",
    "*“We applied {transformation name} because {reasoning behind it}. We expect {change/result} based on {observable measure, such as query speed, number of documents returned, index use, etc.}.”*\n",

    "**Data Cleanup and Schema Adjustments:** [9 points in total]\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Before working on the queries below, review the data and adjust the schema based on the typical use case described.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical Use Case**: The most common use of the database is to show property listing information to customers. A query retrieves a listing document from the database. Currently, retrieving a listing takes too long. Decide what information should be included in a typical query and optimize the structure accordingly. For example, customers usually only need a sample of reviews, not all reviews (even though all reviews are stored). They also don’t need past transaction data. Update the document schema to fit this use case. This might involve creating new collections or documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Cleanup**: Review the data for any errors (such as transactions that don’t belong to the listing) or unnecessary duplication, and clean it up where needed."

    "\n",
    "<font size=\"4\">Different AirBNB departments require different analytics from our common database.\n",
    "Below are the specific questions from various departments: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Standard Difficulty Questions:** [2 points per question]\n",
    "\n",
    "2)\tOnce a month, we reward hosts with recognition. Select three superhosts with at least two listings that can accommodate more than four people.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)\tThe company considers inevsting into property to rent. Which bed type is most common in listings with a waterfront and a dishwasher in New York?\n",
    "\n",
    "4)\tWe're considering hiring someone to write reviews professionally. Who wrote the longest review in New York?\n",
    "\n",
    "5)\tTo assess the security of different areas, what is the biggest and smallest (price-security deposit) difference per number of visitors at a property?\n",
    "\n",
    "6)  Identify areas by whether they are typically used for short breaks, like weekend mini breaks, or whether they are more suitable for long trips. This information support targeted advertising of different customer types. It is not expected to change much over time so we won’t look to update it, we just require current view. What is the average duration of stay (in nights) per type of property per city (you can use the maximum_nights to measure length of stays)? For each property type return the city with the highest and lowest average value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Difficulty Questions (Consider database optimization for these queries):** [3 points per question]\n",
    "\n",
    "7)\tWe are creating a new webpage for hosts when setting up their account. It will list suggested typical amenities. This data will need to be available every time a host registers a property but is not expected to change very much. The starting point for the list will be all unique amenities currently listed in properties (across all documents). Optimise the database for this use case and show how the data should be queried.\n",
    "\n",
    "8)\tWe plan to rtack our reviewers better. We want to create a webpage that shows the top 20 reviewers and the count of the number of reviews of each of these reviewers. This webpage should be kept up to date. It should also have a link to return the number of reviews for a given reviewer ID or Name (show how to query for number of reviews by ID or query quickly).\n",
    "\n",
    "9)\tFor each property we store review scores across different metrics (accuracy, check-in, cleanliness etc). We consider adding more metrics, although there is no clarity on what these will be. We want to be able to easily query the average score across all of these metrics, including any new metrics that might be added without changing the query. Adjust the data model so this can be done and show the query for an example property.\n",
    "\n",
    "10)\tWe aim to have better access to information about transaction, we wish to develop a search engine that can calculate the average value of transactions in a given period of time quickly for a given property.\n",
    "\n",
    "11)\tWe wish to have a summary webpage that displays information about our top destinations. This webpage should display for each of the top 10 cities some basic information about our operations in the area (number of properties by type for example, average price by type) but you can choose the metrics. For each of the top 10 cities it should also provide some basic information about the top 3 properties in each city (price, number of review, whatever you think useful) to show an example of the properties available in the area. We would like to keep this webpage up to date as information changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database updates:** [2 points per question]\n",
    "\n",
    "After optimizing the database, show how to complete the following updates. You can create fictional data. Ensure that previous data does not become stale:\n",
    "\n",
    "12) Add a new property with a new host in one of the top 10 cities. The host selects the top 10 most common amenities to list.\n",
    "\n",
    "13) Add a new review from one of our top 20 reviewers for this new property.\n",
    "\n",
    "14) Add a new review metric called 'x_factor' with a score of 10. Show that the average score across all metrics is correctly calculated for this listing, using the previously developed query.\n"

    "The initial inspection of a sample document and the extraction of all unique field paths (both top-level and nested) reveal a complex structure within the `listingsAndReviews_HW2` collection. We identified **121 unique field paths**, indicating potentially large documents and complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key findings align with the issues mentioned in the homework brief:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Embedded Data & Large Documents:** Significant data is embedded:\n",
    "    *   **Host Information:** Details like `host_name`, `host_about`, `host_location` are repeated for every listing by the same host.\n",
    "    *   **Reviews:** The `reviews` array (and redundant `reviews_copy*` fields) can be very large, directly contributing to the identified performance issues (slow queries) and violating MongoDB's recommendation against unbounded arrays. The average document size is initially ~67 KB, but listings with many reviews are likely much larger.\n",
    "    *   **Transactions:** Transaction data is also embedded within a subdocument.\n",
    "2.  **Redundancy:** The `reviews_copy1` through `reviews_copy4` fields are clear indicators of unnecessary data duplication, wasting storage and complicating updates.\n",
    "3.  **Potential Data Type Issues:** Initial inspection suggests potential inconsistencies (e.g., numbers stored as strings, inconsistent use of `Decimal128`).\n",
    "4.  **Lack of Indexing:** Only the default `_id` index exists, meaning queries filtering or sorting on other fields will require inefficient collection scans.\n",
    "\n",
    "These points confirm the need for schema refactoring to improve performance, scalability, and data integrity. We will address redundancy, data types, and then apply appropriate modeling patterns."

    "##### **Analysing the results**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The table above provides a statistical summary of the fields in the collection `listingsAndReviews_HW2` including the count of documents, distinct values, mean, minimum, and maximum values for each field.\n",
    "- From the analysis, we can verify that most fields are consistent with our expectations, with the exception of a few fields: `maximum_nights`, `bathrooms`, `bedrooms`, and `price.`\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**`maximum_nights`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- As shown in the results above, the maximum value for the field **`maximum_nights` is extremely high** — specifically, $2\\;147\\;483\\;647$. While we know with certainty that no guest will ever book a stay for this many nights, this value appears in the dataset.\n",
    "  - After reviewing Airbnb’s official guidelines (**Source:** https://www.airbnb.pt/help/article/880?), it is confirmed that hosts have full freedom to define any number for the `maximum_nights` field. Therefore, such high values are permitted by Airbnb.\n",
    "  - It is likely that some hosts intentionally set extremely high values to signal that there is effectively no maximum stay limit. These values, although unusually large, are still valid in the context of Airbnb’s platform.\n",
    "  - While these values are valid, in a different context — such as modeling guest behavior or predicting average stay length — they could be treated as statistical outliers. However, since that is not the goal of our current work, we will not perform any data cleaning or transformation for these records.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`bathrooms`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- As shown in the results above, the minimum value for the field **`bathrooms`** is $0$. In some cases this value makes total sense (**Source:** https://community.withairbnb.com/t5/Advice-on-your-space/bathroom-classification/m-p/1652130) while in others it doesn't. \n",
    "   - Properties with types like ***Camper/RV***, ***Tent*** and ***Shared Room*** may not have private bathrooms indicating that the value $0$ makes sense. On the other hand property types like ***Apartment*** and House are unlikely to have $0$ bathrooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`bedrooms`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- As shown in the results above, the minimum value for the field **`bedrooms`** is $0$. \n",
    "  - For properties with types like ***Apartment*** that are **Studios** or **Lofts** this value makes sense potentially reflecting that they share a single open space. \n",
    "  - On the other hand property types like ***House*** are unlikely to have **$0$ bedrooms**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`price`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- As shown in the results above, the maximum value for the field **`price`** is $48\\;842.0$. The field price indicates the price per night for a listing.\n",
    "  - This value is extremely high and seems unrealistic for a single night stay. \n",
    "  - It is possible that this value is a result of data entry errors or outliers in the dataset."

We expect **faster reads for the main `Listings` collection**, **improved performance for time-based queries on transactions** (especially with the index on `Listing_ID` and potentially `Transaction_Date`), and **better scalability for transaction data** (as it can grow independently of the listing document and we have limit of 16MB per document).\n",

These fields provide a useful summary about the transaction history associated with the listing, which might be needed for display without querying the full `Transactions` collection."

    "> We applied **schema restructuring** to create the final `Listings` collection. This involved **removing embedded host details, the full reviews array, and the detailed transactions array**, replacing them with references (`Host_ID`). We **restructured the `review_scores_*` fields into a `Review_Scores` subdocument**, applying the **Attribute Pattern** for flexibility (**Q9**). Key identifying information (`Listing_ID`), frequently accessed data (`Name`, `Price`, `Address`, `Amenities`, etc.), and summary transaction info remain embedded. We expect **significantly faster retrieval of core listing information** for the primary customer-facing use case (**Q1**), as documents are much smaller. The restructured `Review_Scores` allows for flexible querying of score averages.\n"

    "> **Comparison (Q5):** Both queries correctly identify the min/max difference per visitor (**Min:** 0.0, **Max:** 19229.5). The new schema query operates on the `Listings` collection where `Price` and `Security_Deposit` are already correctly typed, simplifying the `$project` stage compared to the original query. The execution time is notably faster in the new schema (0.021s vs 0.032s original), likely due to processing leaner documents and avoiding conversions within the pipeline.\n"

In the original schema, this computation happens on-the-fly through aggregations on embedded arrays, which is inefficient on large datasets or when these queries are frequent.\n",

This implements the **Computed Pattern** fully for review counts. The current implementation prioritizes normalization and relies on indexing for the fast lookup function."

By applying the **Computed Pattern** (adding `ReviewCount` to the `Reviewers` collection) and **Indexing** (`ReviewCount: -1`), retrieving the top 20 reviewers becomes a simple `find().sort().limit()` operation on the `Reviewers` collection. This is significantly faster (~0.64s including the update vs ~0.58s initially - *Note: the aggregation to calculate counts for the update dominates here, but subsequent reads are fast*), as it directly uses the pre-computed and indexed count.\n",
    "> *   **Individual Lookup:** The `get_review_count` function benefits immensely. Instead of aggregating the `Reviews` collection (~0.14s) or the original `listingsAndReviews_HW2` collection, it performs a fast, indexed `find_one` on the `Reviewers` collection using either `Reviewer_ID` (~0.002s) or `Reviewer_Name` (which would benefit from its own index for similar speed).\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates the benefit of the new schema for the frequent, targeted lookup requirement, while the top-20 list might be better handled by pre-computation (**Computed Pattern**) in a production scenario."

    "> **Optimization Analysis (Q10):** Separating transactions into their own collection allows the new query to operate much more efficiently, especially for time-range filters. The original query on the embedded array took ~0.005s for a single document, while the new query on the `Transactions` collection takes ~0.020s initially but benefits from indexing (`Listing_ID_1`, `Transaction_Date_-1`) for potentially much larger datasets or date ranges. The `explain()` output confirms the query efficiently uses the `Listing_ID_1` index (**IXSCAN** stage) .  The rejected plan shows the query planner correctly *avoided* using the `Transaction_Date` index first, as filtering by `Listing_ID` is likely more selective.\n",
    "\n",
    "The compound index `Transaction_Price_-1_Listing_ID_1` was not used by the winning plan for this specific query (as sorting/filtering wasn't primarily on price), justifying its removal to save storage and reduce write overhead."

Performance for recalculating the average on a single document is fast in both. The key advantage is the new schema's adaptability. Updating the optional pre-computed average adds negligible cost."
