    "<font size=\"6\"><b>1. Data Modelling</b></font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=\"4\">Congratulations! You’ve been hired as part of the new Data Engineering and Management team in the AirBNB Business Intelligence department. The company is restructuring due to unsatisfactory performance from the previous teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before leaving, the head of the Data Modelling department highlighted several issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Storage**: A lot of data about AirBNB listings is stored in a single document. While this approach has some advantages, it has also caused performance issues. Queries are slow, and the team didn’t apply patterns, which could improve performance by optimizing the data model. Indexes were also not used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reviews Growth**: The number of reviews for AirBNB is growing rapidly. Currently, we overwrite reviews regularly, but the Business Intelligence department will benefit from storing all reviews and analyzing them over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Errors**: There are errors in the data collection, such as duplicate data entries and incorrect timestamps for transactions. The new team will need to decide how to fix these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Role**: In your new role, you’ll need to consider how each database query is used, how often it is needed, and its impact on reads and writes. You should update the database schema to optimize for business use cases. Use tools like embedding, linking, indexes, and patterns to improve the data model. You may need to create new fields, documents, or collections. Be sure to document the pattern you’re applying and the reasons behind your decisions, especially when dealing with duplication and risks of outdated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key tasks include**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Streamlining the data collection process.\n",
    "2. Cleaning up the data and optimizing what will be returned for each use case.\n",
    "3. Applying the correct patterns to speed up common queries.\n",
    "4. Ensuring departments get accurate and relevant information from the database.\n",
    "5. Sharing the updated data model schema with other departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good Practices**: [Check Chapter 6, Mastering MongoDB]\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All newly created fields should have capitalized names.\n",
    "2. New queries should work with the most up-to-date database version. If you make multiple changes, all queries should still work after the final updates.\n",
    "3. For some queries, you may need to change the database schema.\n",
    "4. When you are applying specific patterns, like polymorphic, subset, or bucket, name them accordingly. \n",
    "5. Document each major transformation using this format:\n",
    "*“We applied {transformation name} because {reasoning behind it}. We expect {change/result} based on {observable measure, such as query speed, number of documents returned, index use, etc.}.”*\n",

    "**Data Cleanup and Schema Adjustments:** [9 points in total]\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Before working on the queries below, review the data and adjust the schema based on the typical use case described.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical Use Case**: The most common use of the database is to show property listing information to customers. A query retrieves a listing document from the database. Currently, retrieving a listing takes too long. Decide what information should be included in a typical query and optimize the structure accordingly. For example, customers usually only need a sample of reviews, not all reviews (even though all reviews are stored). They also don’t need past transaction data. Update the document schema to fit this use case. This might involve creating new collections or documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Cleanup**: Review the data for any errors (such as transactions that don’t belong to the listing) or unnecessary duplication, and clean it up where needed."

    "<font size=\"4\">Different AirBNB departments require different analytics from our common database.\n",
    "Below are the specific questions from various departments: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Standard Difficulty Questions:** [2 points per question]\n",
    "\n",
    "2)\tOnce a month, we reward hosts with recognition. Select three superhosts with at least two listings that can accommodate more than four people.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)\tThe company considers inevsting into property to rent. Which bed type is most common in listings with a waterfront and a dishwasher in New York?\n",
    "\n",
    "4)\tWe're considering hiring someone to write reviews professionally. Who wrote the longest review in New York?\n",
    "\n",
    "5)\tTo assess the security of different areas, what is the biggest and smallest (price-security deposit) difference per number of visitors at a property?\n",
    "\n",
    "6)  Identify areas by whether they are typically used for short breaks, like weekend mini breaks, or whether they are more suitable for long trips. This information support targeted advertising of different customer types. It is not expected to change much over time so we won’t look to update it, we just require current view. What is the average duration of stay (in nights) per type of property per city (you can use the maximum_nights to measure length of stays)? For each property type return the city with the highest and lowest average value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Difficulty Questions (Consider database optimization for these queries):** [3 points per question]\n",
    "\n",
    "7)\tWe are creating a new webpage for hosts when setting up their account. It will list suggested typical amenities. This data will need to be available every time a host registers a property but is not expected to change very much. The starting point for the list will be all unique amenities currently listed in properties (across all documents). Optimise the database for this use case and show how the data should be queried.\n",
    "\n",
    "8)\tWe plan to rtack our reviewers better. We want to create a webpage that shows the top 20 reviewers and the count of the number of reviews of each of these reviewers. This webpage should be kept up to date. It should also have a link to return the number of reviews for a given reviewer ID or Name (show how to query for number of reviews by ID or query quickly).\n",
    "\n",
    "9)\tFor each property we store review scores across different metrics (accuracy, check-in, cleanliness etc). We consider adding more metrics, although there is no clarity on what these will be. We want to be able to easily query the average score across all of these metrics, including any new metrics that might be added without changing the query. Adjust the data model so this can be done and show the query for an example property.\n",
    "\n",
    "10)\tWe aim to have better access to information about transaction, we wish to develop a search engine that can calculate the average value of transactions in a given period of time quickly for a given property.\n",
    "\n",
    "11)\tWe wish to have a summary webpage that displays information about our top destinations. This webpage should display for each of the top 10 cities some basic information about our operations in the area (number of properties by type for example, average price by type) but you can choose the metrics. For each of the top 10 cities it should also provide some basic information about the top 3 properties in each city (price, number of review, whatever you think useful) to show an example of the properties available in the area. We would like to keep this webpage up to date as information changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database updates:** [2 points per question]\n",
    "\n",
    "After optimizing the database, show how to complete the following updates. You can create fictional data. Ensure that previous data does not become stale:\n",
    "\n",
    "12) Add a new property with a new host in one of the top 10 cities. The host selects the top 10 most common amenities to list.\n",
    "\n",
    "13) Add a new review from one of our top 20 reviewers for this new property.\n",
    "\n",
    "14) Add a new review metric called 'x_factor' with a score of 10. Show that the average score across all metrics is correctly calculated for this listing, using the previously developed query.\n"

    "## **📔 List of Potential Errors to Check and Correct**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Inconsistent Data Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fields**: `price`, `security_deposit`, `accommodates`, etc.\n",
    "- **🌋 Issue**: Might be stored as strings (e.g., `\"$100.00\"`, `\"300\"`) or numbers (`100.0`, `300`).\n",
    "- **🔍 Check**: Ensure `price`, `security_deposit`, `accommodates`, etc., are consistently typed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Missing or Null Fields**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fields**: `security_deposit`, `review_scores_*`, `transactions`\n",
    "- **🌋 Issue**: Might be missing in some documents, leading to unexpected results.\n",
    "- **🔍 Check**: Identify missing fields and decide on defaults (e.g., `0` for `security_deposit`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Transactions Mismatches**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **🌋 Issue**: If `transactions.transactions` exists, some entries might not belong to the listing.\n",
    "- **🔍 Check**: Verify each transaction’s context if linked to listings (though `sample_airbnb` doesn’t natively include this field).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Unnecessary Duplication**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **🌋 Issue**: Duplicate listings (same `_id`) or hosts (same `host_id` with different `host_name`) could skew counts.\n",
    "- **🔍 Check**: Look for duplicate `_id` or redundant host entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Case Sensitivity in Strings**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fields**: Amenities like `\"Waterfront\"` vs. `\"waterfront\"` or `\"Dishwasher\"` vs. `\"dishwasher\"`\n",
    "- **🌋 Issue**: Cause mismatches in `$all` filters.\n",
    "- **🔍 Check**: Standardize case in amenities (e.g., all lowercase).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Outliers or Invalid Values**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fields**: Extreme values in `price` (e.g., `$50,000`) or `accommodates` (e.g., `100`) or metrics like `review_scores_*`.\n",
    "- **🌋 Issue**: Might distort averages or differences.\n",
    "- **🔍 Check**: Identify and cap/filter outliers (e.g., `price > 10000` or `review_scores_* > 10`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Date Format Inconsistencies**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fields**: If `transactions.transactions.date` exists, dates might vary (e.g., `\"2008-01-01\"` vs. `\"01/01/2008\"`) or be invalid.\n",
    "- **🌋 Issue**: Could break `$match`.\n",
    "- **🔍 Check**: Standardize date strings or convert to `ISODate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Array vs. String Fields (Specific to `transit`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fields**: `transit` might be a string like `\"Bus • Subway • Train\"` instead of an array `[\"Bus\", \"Subway\", \"Train\"]`.\n",
    "- **🌋 Issue**: Complicates queries.\n",
    "- **🔍 Check**: Confirm if `transit` is always split by `\" • \"`, then convert to an array, but verify exceptions (e.g., commas, newlines).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. Nested Field Assumptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **🌋 Issue**: Queries assume nested structures like `transactions.transactions` or `reviews.reviewer_name`, which might not exist or be misnamed.\n",
    "- **🔍 Check**: Validate field paths (e.g., `transactions` might just be `transactions`, not nested).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **10. Inconsistent Units - Zero or Negative Values**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fields**: `accommodates` as `0` could cause division errors; negative `price` or `security_deposit` might be data entry errors.\n",
    "- **🌋 Issue**: Could lead to logical errors in calculations.\n",
    "- **🔍 Check**: Ensure `accommodates > 0`, `price >= 0`, etc.\n"
